## Course Description
Students have the opportunity to negotiate a programme of learning that is tailored to their own career goals and requirements.

Students enrolling in this MSc are also provided with the opportunity to work on a specialised research task and/or work as part of a research group as part of this programme.

## Testimonial
> Graduate Profile : Rohan Singla, India,
> Assistant Manager : Advisory at Grant Thornton

The reputation of the UCD School of Computer Science and Informatics made me feel secure about my decision to move to Ireland from Mumbai. I was drawn to the wide range of modules available. Through the ‘negotiated learning’ format, I got an option to choose my modules ranging from information security to cloud computing. The masters degree gave me both a theoretical and practical background allowing me to develop and convey technical and strategic advice to my wide range of Fortune 500 clients at work, be it Deloitte in the past or Grant Thornton now. Apart from studies, UCD is a great campus with many activities going on across its parks and student facilities every day.
