### Course Description
Students have the opportunity to negotiate a programme of learning that is tailored to their own career goals and requirements. Instead of there being a rigorous set of modules that each student must take, as is typical in standard taught MSc programmes, students can prefer to broaden their knowledge acrossa diverse cross-section of modules offering by Schools such as the UCD School of Computer Science, UCD School of Business, UCD School of Maths & Statistics and the UCD School of Information & Communication Studies. Students enrolling in this MSc are also provided with the opportunity to work on a specialised research task and/or work as part of a research group as part of this programme.

### Vision and Values Statement
- Purpose
This programme aims to provide students with a wide range of specialist learning opportunities that can be selected in a bespoke manner to suit the individual skills and aspirations of the individual.  It can thus serve both as a form of extended continued professional development, as a means to upskill or to reorient a technical career.  The programme is also suited as a foundation for advanced research within IT. An extensive variety of learning pathways is offered, with many modules grouped into thematic streams, providing coherent clusters in specific technical areas.  

- Education and subject description, professional values
It aspires to offer state of the art instruction in a very wide variety of technical subjects, leveraging the broad range of expertise available in the faculty of UCD.  For the student, it provides an opportunity to personally design a course of study that matches their specific goals.  Modules range over many technical specialities that are in high demand with employers. 

- Learning outcomes
Students will select modules from a very broad list, and will therefore encounter many different kinds of instruction.  Many students will take part in group projects of a practical nature. The variety of modules on offer ensures that students can develop both technical skills and enhance their critical thinking. 

- Approaches to teaching learning and assessment
Because of the variety of courses on offer, many different forms of evaluation may be used, including exercises, written assignments, programming challenges, literature reviews and end of module examinations.  The programme aspires to encourage the intellectual skills required to synthesise and integrate insights from many perspectives. 

### Programme Outcomes

### Testimonial
> Graduate Profile : Rohan Singla, India,
> Assistant Manager : Advisory at Grant Thornton

The reputation of the UCD School of Computer Science and Informatics made me feel secure about my decision to move to Ireland from Mumbai. I was drawn to the wide range of modules available. Through the ‘negotiated learning’ format, I got an option to choose my modules ranging from information security to cloud computing. The masters degree gave me both a theoretical and practical background allowing me to develop and convey technical and strategic advice to my wide range of Fortune 500 clients at work, be it Deloitte in the past or Grant Thornton now. Apart from studies, UCD is a great campus with many activities going on across its parks and student facilities every day.
