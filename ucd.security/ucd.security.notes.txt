DISCRETE INFORMATION SOURCE : any device that sequentially generates element from a discrete alphabet
>>>> _()_ = { a,b,....w, z, space }

DISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLE: defined by mapping element from omega to an alphabet  
	>>> p|x = 2|
	>>> p|x = 64|
	>>> p|x = 222|
>>> means PMF 
  probability of mass functions (pmf) 
  >>> X| x,y, .... xn = assign 
| size of the set |

the expectation of rb is the sum of ll its possible outcomes 

E(x) is also the average of x
sigma means sum of something
