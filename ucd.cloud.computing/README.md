# Cloud Computing (UG) (COMP30520)
Nowadays Cloud Computing is everywhere. Cloud Computing (CC) is not a revolution of Information technology (IT), but It is one of the key evolution steps of IT. It provides computing as a utility, which has recently emerged as a commercial reality. The main characteristics of CC are 1) the illusion of infinite computing and storage resources, 2) the ability to pay-as-you-use, and 3) the elimination of an up-front commitment by Cloud users. In other words, CC is a style of computing in which can be scaled dynamically and virtualised resources are provided as a service over the Network. The key idea behind this course is to provide fundamental CC topics taking into account both technology and business considerations. The course is divided into a series of lectures, each of which is accompanied by one or more hands-on exercises. Among the topics that will be covered in this course are:

- Fundamental CC terminology and concepts
- CC definition an its specific characteristics
- Benefits, Challenges and Risks of CC platforms and Services
- Roles of CC administrator and owners
- SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS delivery models and their combinations
- Various Public, Private, and hybrid CC environments
- Business Cost models and Service Level Agreements for CC
- Case Studies: Google Cloud, Microsoft Cloud, and Amazon Cloud

# What will I learn?

- Understand How the Cloud integrates technologies, such as Parallel or Distributed computing.
- Relate the impact of economies of scale to CC, and identify the main security problems that affect this technology.
- Identify the technologies used by the majority of the cloud providers.
- Design and implement CC applications that can use one of the existing CC.
