Online Todo list such as Trello is a task-management web application. It allows users to create new
tasks, edit or delete existing tasks, and search for tasks. Indeed, it also allows users to share
their tasks. In this project, the students are asked to develop an online task-management with the
following operations:

a. Create new tasks,
b. Edit or delete existing tasks,
c. Search for tasks,
d. Time slots booking,
e. Share tasks or the whole Todo list.

This online Todo list can be stored in cloud-based storage. Students can use any web development
tools to develop this online Todo list. (Cloudera platform recommendation)
