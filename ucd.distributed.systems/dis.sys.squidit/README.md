## SQUIDIT : A CROWD-VOTED CONTENT SITE

We aim to create an application that is based on the life cycle of a video. In our project, the lifecycle of the video will be based on the on the amount of times the video is liked by users. Users will be able to log in, upload videos and rate other crowd-supplied content.
What we really want to achieve is the constant reminder of time acting on our videos. Once a video is uploaded, it will have a set lifetime before being removed from the site. Only a user’s “like” can stretch its lifespan ensuring that only quality content remains on our site. If this was implemented successfully, an additional feature that we want to add is the ability of users to subscribe to our site’s newsletter service and will then be sent daily/weekly newsletters containing videos related to content that they have made aware to us they are interested in. Each video uploaded will have certain metadata such as its general category and runtime and we can use this information to search through videos related to certain categories and serve this to ours users.
The technologies that we are thinking of using for this project consists of web based languages. We are interested in MEAN or NODE without a framework and would like to use these technologies along with libraries that npm would provide. These languages would give us the ease of executing our concept we believe to its fullest potential. We also would like to create a server based with node and our database provider will include mongoDB. We intend to use REST web services along with AJAX functions to optimise the architecture of our program.
Please feel free to let us know if this is concept does not meet the module’s standards. The idea of the project is complete we feel but if you recommend us to use other technologies that would best suit the outcome of this project like Java and the Spring Boot framework to be part of our web service or other types of languages, we will gladly reshape our concept.
