READING GROUP MARKING SCHEME

5   	   - Good engagement, good comments, presented clearly and concisely.
3.4 	   - Good engagement, some good comments, but clarity sometimes lacking.
1.2 	   - Presented their comment, but little or no additional  contribution.
0   	   - Did not attend.


You will be marked down if you attempt to dominate the group 
(the idea is to have an open and inclusive chat with your group members, not to compete with one another).

// you can use the following questions as a guide for the synopsis (don’t use them as headings – in fact, please don’t use headings at all)
// What is the paper about? What are the main features / issues discussed? What makes the proposed solution good (in the eyes of the authors)
// How was it evaluated and what did the evaluation show?

// We will check that the comment you give in the reading group is one of the ones listed here. 
// Each one should be no more than 3 sentences. Obviously, this comment is not correct because I have used 4 sentences!
// hen you add references above, what I am really looking for is for you to cite those references in the synopsis, 
// for example you could highlight a limitation of the system reviewed, pointing out that the criticism was taken from 
// another paper/article/website, even quoting from that other paper. Note: this is a bad 
// comment because the sentence is too long!•Comment 3•Comment 4•Comment 5
