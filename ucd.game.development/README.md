# GAME DEVELOPMENT (COMP30540)
The module will provide an introduction to the essentials of computer game development. 
The process of development by small independents, even single individuals, shares important features with development by large companies: innovation, creativity, storyboarding, software development, testing, deployment and (sometimes) marketing. 
Topics to be covered include: the economic importance of the computer game industry; common genres of games; the development of game software using specialized tools which promote rapid development through their integration of numerous prepackaged components; techniques for representing objects in 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional space, and determining whether they collide; techniques for equipping non-player characters with AI; techniques for producing special effects;gamification, that is, the provision of enjoyably gamelike experience to promote education or customer loyalty or other purposes.
Practical work will give experience of small-scale game development using specialized software tools.
