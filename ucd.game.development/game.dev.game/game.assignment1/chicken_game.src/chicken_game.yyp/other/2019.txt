2019 egg collector 

# REQ 

**   short report
**  any code (scripts) you have written to make it work.
**  15-20 minutes including talking time
**  make an executable so the game can run independently.

notes: screen rec of GameMaker may not be the best choice.
>>>>  2-3 minute screen recording
>>>>  provide a low-resolution 

# STORY 
>>  two workers: catch eggs as they are laid by chickens above
: in line
>> >> WHEN CHICKEN LAYS EGGS  :   CHICKEN CHANGES

>> catcher character and collector character on the right 

>>> if basket gets too full new eggs are :  new eggs can BREAK EASY (existing) 

>>> hay gets dropped randomly… new hay is needed when eggs are dropped 

>>>  be promoted to a better job where the eggs are laid more frequently and/or more quickly; 
: or be fired from the job (game over) if too many eggs get broken.

rails on which chickens stand,

Chickens take a random amount of time between laying an egg and feeling another one coming on.

# KEYS 
ZXCVM - 
 Z = left catcher move fast leftward (from your point of view)
C = left catcher move slowly rightward, and so on

The catchers cannot be made to stop + edge of screen

cv - fast/slow
m - collect

 Pressing the space bar causes new hay to be dropped

when chicken lays: 
pulse between a larger and a smaller size

You don’t need to show eggs either on or under hay, 
Breakage is just a matter of probability.

DROP HAY = NEEDS 2 of them at a time 

If the catchers collide with each other, they lose half their unprotected eggs, or all of them if both are moving at top speed.

levels of difficulty : 
- normal 
- hard 
- simple 

smaller basket, more sluggish response to keys for moving the catchers, eggs being laid more frequently, more chickens, greater chances of eggs getting smashed.

OTHER + 

Experiment
Experiment to find satisfying values for various quantities, such as for example:
- speeds (of egg and hay falling, of catcher )
- formulas (for picking which chicken will lay at what time, for breakage of unprotected eggs)
- constants (how much time must a chicken rest before it could possibly lay its next egg, how
many eggs can get broken before you lose)

notes: Do not waste a lot of your time on fancy artwork or animation.

REPORT : 
-  report on what you have achieved
- include screenshots of the menu system
- a few (static) highlights from play of your game
- Describe the events (such as key presses and key releases, and timers) that make your game work
= not exceed three pages of text unless 

SUBMISSION: 
to 20Mb.

the executable, the report, and a screen recording.  

Recordings of ~200Mb not appropriate  = don’t want  Google Drive 

PEN ALTIES: 

 if submitted up to one week late, 10% will be lost (turning 62% into 52% for example); if submitted even later but within two weeks, 20% will be lost; if not submitted within two weeks, barring extenuating circumstances, all marks will be lost.

————————————————————————————————

Submission Do’s
Do put your name and student number in the first few lines of the report, and in comments in the first few lines of each source-code script file you write. Write scripts in GameMaker’s GML rather than using its drag-and-drop facility, and submit them too.
Do use moodle to submit a .zip containing
- your source code files (including GameMaker GML scripts)
- your report
- a 2-3 minute low-resolution screen recording of you playing the game
Do make that zip file unzip into a folder bearing your name. Temporarily rename your own copy while making the zip file to achieve this.
Do print and sign an assessment submission form: scan it or photograph it, and include it in your zip file.

++++++ 

Submission Don’ts
Do not include anything that is not either source code, your report, your recording or your submission form.
Do not present your report as anything other than pdf. Avoid, for example, .doc and .docx and .odt and .rtf.
Do not submit a .rar, .jar, .7z, or any other form of archive except .zip.
Do not place folders inside folders, even within a .zip, just one folder of files. Do not provide multiple versions of your code.
Do not send an email to submit your assignment, use only the moodle.
Each of the above don’ ts violated may attract a penalty of 5%. Do not give your submission an awkward filename. Just use your own name for it.
