# Advanced Data Structures in Java (O/L) (COMP47500)
This module is suitable for students interested in Java programming language and the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures. In part A of this module, the students will learn how to analyse, design and implement a finite set of well-defined instructions for accomplishing some task (an algorithm). Students will be introduced to an object-oriented paradigm as the framework of choice for building robust and reusable algorithms. Students need to pass with at least 70% to proceed to Part B of this module. Part B will emphasize on ways of storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently (a data structure). A well-designed data structure or algorithm allows a variety of critical operations to be performed using as little resource, both execution time and memory space, as possible. Part B will cover Stacks, Queues, Deques, Priority Queues, associative memory structures (Dictionaries), linked structures (Graphs), text processing and representation, as well as the core algorithms that complement each structure. A range of implementation techniques are examined, with emphasis being given to the complexity of the various solutions and their applicability to different problem domains.

# What will I learn?
On successful completion of this module the students will be able to:
-	Understand how to determine the amount of resources (such as time and storage) necessary to execute a particular algorithm (algorithm analysis);
-	Understand the object-oriented JAVA programming constructs needed to encode an algorithm;
-	Understand the structure, nature and use of fundamental data structures including, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Dictionaries, Graphs etc.;
-	Understand the object-oriented programming constructs needed to encode a data structure and its access algorithms;
-	Design programs using these constructs to solve large problems;
-	Successfully write, compile, debug and run programs using these constructs;
-	Analyse problems to determine the most appropriate data structures and algorithms that may be applicable to them.
