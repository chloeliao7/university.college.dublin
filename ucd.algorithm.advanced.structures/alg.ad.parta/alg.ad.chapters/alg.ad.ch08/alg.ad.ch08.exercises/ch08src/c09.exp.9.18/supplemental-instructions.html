<p>Here is a sample program run:</p>
<pre>&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in
its own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys&amp;rsquo; house. The wife
had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with
a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she
had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in
the same house with him ...&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>Use the following class as your main class:</p>
<pre>public class TextDemo
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      IText text = new MockText();
      while (...)
      {
         String type = ...;
         System.out.println("&lt;" + type + "&gt;" + cleanup(...) + 
            "&lt;/" + type + "&gt;");
      }
   }

   public static String cleanup(String text)
   {
      String result = text.replace("&", "&amp;");
      result = result.replace("``", "&ldquo;"); 
      result = result.replace("''", "&ldquo;"); 
      result = result.replace("`", "&lsquo;"); 
      result = result.replace("'", "&rsquo;"); 
      result = result.replace("--", "&emdash;"); 
      result = result.replace("&lt;", "&lt;"); 
      result = result.replace("&gt;", "&gt;"); 
      return result;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Use the following classes in your solution:</p>
<pre>public interface IText
{
   /**
      Checks whether there is another segment
      @return true if there is another segment
   */
   boolean hasMoreSegments();

   /**
      Gets the type of the next segment
      @return the type such as p or h1
   */
   String nextSegmentType();

   /**
      Reads the text of the next segment
      @return the text of the next segment
   */
   String nextSegment();
}
<hr />
/**
   Produce a document with three sections of type h1, p, and p
   whose contents is given in the problem statement.
*/

public class MockText ...
{
   ...
}
</pre>
