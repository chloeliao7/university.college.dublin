<p>Here is a sample program run:</p>
<pre>Please enter your income: 
<b>40000
</b>Tax: 400.0
</pre>
<p>Use the following class as your main class:</p>
<pre>import java.util.Scanner;

/**
   This program calculates taxes based on the original
   U.S. income tax schedule in 1913.
*/
public class TaxCalculator
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {  
      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

      System.out.println("Please enter your income: ");
      double income = in.nextDouble();

      TaxReturn aTaxReturn = new TaxReturn(income);

      System.out.println("Tax: " + aTaxReturn.getTax());
   }
}
</pre>
<p>You need to supply the following class in your solution:</p>
<pre>TaxReturn
</pre>
