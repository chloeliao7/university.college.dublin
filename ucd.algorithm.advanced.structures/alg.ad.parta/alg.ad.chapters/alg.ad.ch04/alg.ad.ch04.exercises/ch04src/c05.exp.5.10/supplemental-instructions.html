<p>Here is a sample program run:</p>
<pre>Please enter the first time in military time (hour minute): 
<b>15 45
</b>Please enter the second time in military time (hour minute): 
<b>8 30
</b>The first time is after the second time.
</pre>
<p>Use the following class as your main class:</p>
<pre>import java.util.Scanner;

/**
   This program compares two military times and
   determines which comes first.
*/
public class TimeComparer
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {  
      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

      System.out.println("Please enter the first time in military time (hour minute): ");
      int hour1 = in.nextInt();
      int minute1 = in.nextInt();

      System.out.println("Please enter the second time in military time (hour minute): ");
      int hour2 = in.nextInt();
      int minute2 = in.nextInt();
      
      Time time1 = new Time(hour1, minute1);
      Time time2 = new Time(hour2, minute2);
      
      String comp = time1.compareWith(time2);
      System.out.println("The first time is " + comp + " the second time.");      
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Complete the following class in your solution:</p>
<pre>/**
   This class compares two military times and
   determines which comes first.
*/
public class Time
{
   private int hour;
   private int minute;
   
   public Time(int anHour, int aMinute)
   {
      . . .
   }

   /**
      Compares this time against another time.
      @param time2 the time to compare with
      @return "before" if this time comes before time2,
      "" if the times are the same, and "after" otherwise
   */   
   public String compareWith(Time time2)
   {
      . . .   
   }
}
</pre>
