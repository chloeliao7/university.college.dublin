<p>Here is a sample program run:</p>
<pre>Enter the card notation:
<b>4S</b>Four of Spades
</pre>
<p>Use the following class as your main class:</p>
<pre>import java.util.Scanner;

/**
   This is a test for the Card class, which outputs the full
   description of a deck of cards.
*/
public class CardPrinter
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
      
      System.out.println("Enter the card notation:");
      String input = in.nextLine();
      Card card = new Card(input);
      System.out.println(card.getDescription());
   }
}



</pre>
<p>You need to supply the following class in your solution:</p>
<pre>Card
</pre>
