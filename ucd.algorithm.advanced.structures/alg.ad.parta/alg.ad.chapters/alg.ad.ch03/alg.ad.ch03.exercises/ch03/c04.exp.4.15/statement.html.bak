<p>Write a program that reads two times in military format (0900, 1730) and prints the number of hours and minutes between the two times. Here is a sample run. User input is in color.
<pre><font face="Courier New">
Please enter the first time: <font color="#0abbf5">0900</font>
Please enter the second time: <font color="#0abbf5">1730</font>
8 hours 30 minutes
</font></pre>
Extra credit if you can deal with the case where the first time is later than the second time:
<pre><font face="Courier New">
Please enter the first time: <font color="#0abbf5">1730</font>
Please enter the second time: <font color="#0abbf5">0900</font>
15 hours 30 minutes
</font></pre>
Implement a class <font face="Courier New">TimeInterval</font> whose constructor takes two military times. The class should have two methods <font face="Courier New">getHours</font> and <font face="Courier New">getMinutes</font>.</p>
<p>Your main class should be called <font face="Courier New">ElapsedTimePrinter</font>.</p>
