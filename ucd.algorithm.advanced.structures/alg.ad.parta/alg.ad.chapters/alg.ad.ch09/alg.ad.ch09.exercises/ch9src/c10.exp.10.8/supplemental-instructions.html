<p>Here is a sample program run:</p>
<pre>Who was the inventor of Java?
Your answer: 
<b>James Gosling
</b>true
In which country was the inventor of Java born?
1: Australia
2: Canada
3: Denmark
4: United States
Your answer: 
<b>2
</b>true
</pre>
<p>Use the following class as your main class:</p>
<pre>import java.util.Scanner;

public class QuestionDemo
