# HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION (COMP47680)
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a distinctive branch of computer science dedicated to understanding the relationship between people and computers. It provides a set of techniques that enable designers and software engineers to develop computing applications that better respond to the needs, abilities and interests of customers, clients and end-users. This module provides theoretical grounding, practical knowledge, and hands on experience of key skills needed to design and build better interfaces for computing systems.
The module addresses core areas of the ACM SIGCHI Curricula for Human-Computer Interaction and is intended for students with diverse disciplinary backgrounds and experiences, including Computer Science, Cognitive Science and Design.

The module covers the following core topics:
1. Human cognition and models of interaction
2. Usability and user experience
3. Experimental design and statistics for HCI
4. Interface design using user-centred and iterative methods
5. Design thinking and rapid prototyping
6. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation strategies

It also introduces advance topics within the field of HCI. For example: 
- Intelligent and next generation user interfaces
- Information visualization
- Social impact interfaces for health and sustainability

Advanced topics are addressed through concrete case studies of successful and innovative design projects.

## What will I learn?
On completing the module, students will be able to:
1. Understand different theoretical perspectives on cognition and human behaviour that are relevant to the design of interactive systems.
2. Propose and apply design approaches that are suitable to different classes of interactive system.
3. Rapidly prototype new interactive systems.
4. Identify appropriate techniques for analysis and critique of user interfaces.
5. Undertake quantitative and qualitative studies in order to evaluate and improve the design of interactive systems.
