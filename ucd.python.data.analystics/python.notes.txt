Assignments

Assignment 1: Deadline 25th March (Wk8)
Assignment 2: Deadline 26th April (Wk12)

>> Sets are unordered lists which contain NO DUPLICATE VALUES!!! 
>> They can be created from lists, strings or any other iterable value, using the set function. Sets do not have an order, so we cannot index into them by position.
 
 3**2 is a power to 
 
 fullist[1:] # all items from the 2nd one onwards
 fullist[:4] # start at 1st item, end before 5th item
 
THE FIRST ASSIGNMENT IS AVAILABLE ON THE MOODLE (SEE WK 5).
THE SECOND ASSIGNMENT WILL BE RELEASED BEFORE WEEK 9 - A DRAFT (NOT DEFINITIVE) IS BELOW.

## Intro to DATA SCIENCE 

The data era - Vs 
volume, 
velocitty, 
variety, 
veracity: truthfullness of data

math + stats skills -> tech + hacking skills -> domain expertise

Examples of common data science tasks; 

 prediction, 
 regression, 
 clustering, 
 anomaly detection,
 visualization
 
 KDD: Raw Data =/ valuable or actionable insight 
 
 raw data -> target data -> clean data -> transform data -> pattern result -> knowledge 
 
 ABT : crisp-dm : basic structure used to represent datase
 TABULAR DATA: 
 
 Data Availability: do we have access to the data required to the create feature 
 Timing: when will the data require 
 Longevity: 
 
 ---
 
 Data Acquisition: Collect/import data from a variety of different sources
 Data Preparation: Clean, manipulate and aggregate data into a form that can be analysed
 Reporting & Visualisation: Interpret results, summarise & disseminate them in a compelling way
 Analysis & Modeling: Apply algorithms to explore relationships and make predictions
 
 ---
 
 CRISP-DM Model:  ANALYTICS BASE TABLE (ABT)!!!
 
1. Business Understanding: What is the business problem?
2. Data Understanding: What is the data required to solve the business problem?
3. Data Preparation: Where is the data, how should it be collected, transformed, and stored?
4. Modeling: What data mining algorithms should be used to solve the business problem, given the data available?
5. Evaluation: How well do the algorithms work?
6. Deployment: How can the analytics results/model be
integrated into the current workflow for the organisation?


Ordinal -> Textual -> interval -> binary -> original -> categorical -> numeric 


1. Data availability: Do we have access to the data required to create the feature?
2. Timing: When will the data required for the feature be available? 
3. Longevity: How long will the data used in a feature stay
relevant? Will it quickly become "stale" or inaccurate?


ABT + Features: 
- RAW FEATURES: 
		1. These come directly from the original data.
- DERIVED FEATURES: 
		2. Do not exist in the original data, but are constructed in some way from the raw data.
		
		
1. Brainstorm features: Understand the business problem, explore the data, study previous solutions from other tasks/domains. Identify availability, timing, and longevity constraints.
2. Devise features: Manually and/or automatically create raw and/ or derived representative features from the data.
3. Select features: Identify subset of all possible features, which provide one or more “views” for our models to operate upon.
4. Evaluate models: Estimate how effective the features were for the analytics problem that we are trying to solve.
