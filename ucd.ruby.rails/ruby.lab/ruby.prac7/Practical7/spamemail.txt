Based on the doctors reports that i might not live up to three months. My late husband family intentions is to allow me die in this condition because I do not have a child, this have made me source for a Godly person abroad who will make this claim of $10 Million dollars which is deposited in a security firm. I decided to bequeath the sum of $10,000,000.00 to you. If you are much more interested, Contact Barr.

LET US TAKE CARE OF YOUR PTC CLAIMS. grebs FUND BENEFICIARY. Because of the recent “EU Financial Mop-up Exercise”, the EU Funds Release Institution in Switzerland discovered many “Financial Payment Malpractices” on “Inheritance&Contract PTC Claims” and, payment files that have since been abandoned. Your e-mail address happens to be on one of such files and that`s the reason you`re being contacted. CONGRATULATIONS! It`s evident from your “Payment File” that because of having been working with corrupt officials and, sometimes, impostors; you have been paying unending “up-front”Bills and Charges on your claims for International Funds Transfer (IFT), without having your claims successfully approved and paid out to you. We`re here to help! But, first, this is what you must do… you MUST STOP any further communications with any officials regarding your payment claims, especially, in Africa. Your funds will be paid out after the final verification process in Switzerland, at no cost, through the assigned financial institution in the UK. You`re advised therefore, to revert to this office immediately upon receipt of this e-mail message, to commence the hitch-free process of claiming your Inheritance/Contract funds. Please contact Mr. Dietmar Grebs at Email Address:( dietmargrebs9@) for further instructions. Remember…. It`s at no cost and it`s hitch-free!
