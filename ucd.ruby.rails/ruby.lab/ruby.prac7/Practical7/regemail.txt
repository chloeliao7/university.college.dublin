All
So I have dumped a bunch of these previous class exams paper into the Week 12 section of the Moodle page. NB; these are class exams so you should only be looking at them from the point of view of the types of questions asked; these papers have different general properties that should be ignored (e.g., time for paper). Best and good luck, Mark
