Explorations in Ruby: PracticalsWeek 5: Practical 5

1) The main task this week is to get the iTunes program going and see how it runs. 
Start by looking at the two .csv files. Change these to be your own songs, and 
make sure the owners list corresponds to what you have done. 

2) The methods for building all albums are empty. Please do the man make them

3) If you get the song-ids wrong in the .csv files, all hell breaks loose. Check 
this. The think about adding some methods to the program that could do some 
simple checks to catch such input errors.
